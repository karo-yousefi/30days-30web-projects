# 3Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ days, 3Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ web applications (Vanilla JS)

<br>

‚úÖ A **30-day challenge** to code every day and make something "interesting" üåü

‚úÖ I tried to make **unique** projects rather than what you've all seen online (To-Do lists, Calculators, etc) üí†

‚úÖ All the projects are **documented** üìÉ, Feel free to fork the code and make changes or do the **challenge yourself** üí™, Either these projects or your own ideas 

‚úÖ I try to build at least two projects for each important topic in JS (APIs, DOM Manipulation, Async, etc)
